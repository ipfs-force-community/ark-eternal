# 🌊 Ark Eternal — Decentralized Web Snapshot Archiving

> **Preserve the Web. Eternal. Immutable. Yours.**  
> Powered by Filecoin Proof of Data Possession (PDP)

## 🚀 Introduction

**Ark Eternal** is a decentralized web archiving and data preservation protocol. It empowers users to capture, preserve, and cryptographically verify snapshots of any webpage — permanently stored on decentralized storage.

In a world where digital information is fragile, manipulable, and easily censored, **Ark Eternal** acts as your personal digital ark — safeguarding truth, preserving knowledge, and empowering data ownership.

## 🌍 Vision

> **A decentralized, censorship-resistant, and immutable archive of human knowledge.**  

We envision a future where anyone can capture and preserve online content — from research papers to social media posts, from government records to historical moments — transforming the fragile internet into a permanent, trustless archive that no one can alter or erase.

## 🏗️ How It Works

1. 🔗 **Input** — Enter a title and the URL you want to preserve.
2. 📸 **Capture** — Generate a snapshot of the webpage.
3. 🗄️ **Store** — Upload the snapshot to decentralized storage with cryptographic proof via **Filecoin PDP**.
4. 🔐 **Verify** — Preview, download, and verify the snapshot's existence and integrity at any time.
