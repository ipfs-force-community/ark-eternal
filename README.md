# Ark Eternal — Decentralized Web Snapshot Archiving

**Preserve the Web. Immutable. Yours.**
Powered by Filecoin Proof of Data Possession (PDP)

---

## Introduction

**Ark Eternal** is a decentralized web snapshot archiving protocol. It empowers anyone to capture, store, and verify web page snapshots on decentralized storage networks with cryptographic proof.

Resources are stored under unique **Content Identifiers (CIDs)**. Users can seamlessly retrieve snapshots and assets anytime through their CIDs — ensuring the web remains **immutable, verifiable, and accessible**.

## Vision

A censorship-resistant, permanent archive of human knowledge.
Turn fragile online content into immutable records owned by users.

---

## How It Works

1. Input a title and URL
2. Capture a snapshot of the page
3. Store it on decentralized storage (Filecoin + PDP)
4. Verify, view, and download anytime
5. Access resources via shared CIDs
